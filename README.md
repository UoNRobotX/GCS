# GCS
Ground Control Station

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and CD into the cloned directory
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and devDependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to build the project using Webpack and setup a watcher
4. Open up the index.html file in public in a web browser - use live-server (`npm run -g live-server && live-server`)

## Public files
Each time the project is built files in `server/public` are removed and replaced by auto generated files. So don't
add or change files in there.
